## Introduction 

Train checker allows the user to independently conduct workouts and choose their intensity.

## Features

- Individual settings
- Track sets for each exercise
- The description of each exercise has an image

## Future plans
- [x] create basic app
- [x] add intensity
- [ ] add training history
- [ ] add the use of a neural network to identify user errors in exercise technique
